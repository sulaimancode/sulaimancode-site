			<p class="mb-4">
				I am a software engineer with 4+ years of professional experience. I have a deep passion for
				building and creating with code. I first began teaching myself to code using online
				resources, but I soon realized I needed a more immersive learning experience. That's when I
				discovered <a class="text-blue-200 hover:underline" href="https://www.makers.tech/"
					>Makers</a
				>, an intensive coding bootcamp where I had the opportunity to learn alongside an incredible
				group of peers.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Since then, I've worked across the stack, but I have a particular affinity for frontend
				technology. I've honed my skills in Typescript, Javascript, React, Redux, and
				React-testing-library, and I'm always eager to learn more about the latest tools and
				techniques in the field.

				Currently I'm working at

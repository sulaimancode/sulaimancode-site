My personal website created using [SvleteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Developing

Install dependcies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
